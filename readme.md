# 🏙️ 12-735: Urban Systems Modeling (Spring 2025)

This repo contains my assignments, notes, and experiments for **12-735: Urban Systems Modeling** at **CMU**.  
Just a place to track my progress and explore probabilistic modeling for infrastructure systems!  

## 📌 What's in here?
- `hw/` – Homework assignments  
- `inclass/` – Class exercises and practice  
- `proj/` – Course project work  
- `playground.py` – Random experiments and calculations  

## 🏗️ Course Overview
This course focuses on **probabilistic modeling and risk assessment** for civil infrastructure systems, covering:  
- Bayesian decision-making & risk analysis  
- Graphical models for infrastructure networks  
- Monte Carlo simulations & reliability analysis  
- Urban system risk assessment  

Taught by **Prof. Matteo Pozzi**.
